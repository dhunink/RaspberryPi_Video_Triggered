# RaspberryPi_Video_Triggered
Playing/pausing playback of a video on Raspberry Pi by one or more hardware triggers

Uses the excellent Python OMXPlayer wrapper (found on https://github.com/willprice/python-omxplayer-wrapper and https://pypi.python.org/pypi/omxplayer-wrapper )

Tested with a Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian and bootstrapped using PiFinder (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Pi-Finder).
